# MMsimulation
### Description
A Monte Carlo method coupled to a genetic optimization algorithm to simulate DNA replication and compare the results to experimental data.

### Software dependencies
Functions in function folder to set in path. 
Functions in matlab
### Hardware and OS Requirements
The simulation and fit require a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations. 
The code has been tested on a computer with the following specifications: 6 cores, 2.60 GHz, 32GB RAM.
The code has been tested on the following systems: Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04.

### Installation
To use the code, clone the repository on your computer and open the repository in the 

# Demo
Expected about 45min for one optimization of the simulation.
